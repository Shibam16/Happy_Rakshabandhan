          Raksha Bandhan is a day that fills my heart with warmth and nostalgia. I find myself reminiscing about the countless moments we've shared, each one contributing to the unbreakable bond we have today. From the early days of our sibling rivalry to the deep friendship we've built over the years, every memory with you is a treasure I hold dear. 
          You’ve always been there, not just as a sister, but as someone who understands me in ways no one else can.

          As we celebrate Raksha Bandhan this year, I am reminded of the countless times you've stood up for me and protected me. You've always had my back, no matter the situation, and that sense of security you provide is something I cherish deeply.
           It's comforting to know that no matter what challenges life throws our way, we’ll face them together, just as we always have.

           I pray that our bond continues to grow stronger and that you are blessed with all the happiness in the world. Happy Raksha Bandhan!
